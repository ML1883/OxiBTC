# OxiBTC

This is a dropped project that generators bitcoin addresses in Rust. Purely to discover the Rust language and the Bitcoin protocol.

This code is not maintained. There are absolutely zero warranties for this generator whatsover.

I have some files pertaining to transactions but I stopped developing them through. Once I found out the Rust Bitcoin package's example code didn't even work, I dropped this project.
